                        Hi, I am Anum Shabbir working as a Software QA Engineer at Decker IP (Medical Publisher). I joined this company October 2017
                        and my first job as QA engineer ever since I immigrated to Canada 3 years ago. I worked as an IT
                        and Database Engineer at Diamond Yarn of Canada before this for about 6 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have always been passionate about programming and working with code and developers. Recently I decided
                        to step up and learn to code myself too, and joined a BootCamp Course at UofT - This portfolio is
                        part of the assignment I am working on. I have worked with Java, C++ and Python, did little chunks
                        of programming for automation testing on Selenium. </p>
